# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Prediction Accuracy 99.12%
## Business Context:
Breast cancer is a significant public health concern affecting millions of women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assist in breast cancer diagnosis by analyzing relevant patient data.
## Methodology:

1- Data Acquisition and Import: Relevant breast cancer datasets will be imported and prepared for analysis.

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and uncover potential insights.
* Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual features to understand their distribution and statistical properties.
* Bivariate Analysis: Examining relationships between pairs of features to identify correlations and dependencies.
* Multivariate Analysis: Exploring the interactions among multiple features to uncover complex patterns.
* Correlation Matrix: Visualizing correlations between features to identify potential redundancies.
  
3- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure data quality and suitability for modeling.
* Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing data through appropriate imputation techniques.
* Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers to prevent model bias.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
* Log Transformation: Applying log transformations to variables with skewed distributions for normalization.
* Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for the prediction model.
* Multicollinearity: Assessing the correlation between independent variables using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while preserving essential information.
  
4- Model Building and Evaluation: Developing and evaluating machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis prediction.

5- Model Selection: Exploring various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and selecting the most suitable model based on performance metrics.

6- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or randomized search.

7- Final Result: Presenting the developed model's performance, insights gained from the analysis, and potential implications for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.
